- STRUCTURE OF THE SYNTHESIZER
In order to make our plugin more professional,
implement all the Goals we have set ourselves,
and the possibility of future expansions,
we have organized the division of the file system into two main parts,
the front-end and the back-end.
In the production pipeline we started by making concepts for the design of the plug in,
drawing it by hand, for better visualize the future position of each components.
And in the front end code we have instantiated in the AudioPluginEditor class one object for
each components that are displayed on the interface, Starting by Custom Objects,
such as animation, rotary and ADSR.
Each component depends on a custom class called StyleData which manages all the graphic style of the plugin, and the colour Palette.
